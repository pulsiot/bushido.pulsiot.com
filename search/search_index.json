These philosophical codes and guiding principles were specifically for the samurai warriors.</p> <p>During the medieval period in Japan, the samurai were present to serve their lord and protect the land.

It is to guarantee that the person avoids indecisiveness and that decisions are based on the proper reasons.</p> <p>Yu \u2013 Courage Yu is focused on ensuring that an individual does and has the courage to do the right thing, not what others expect them to do. If a person is raised particularly, they have their own beliefs that they follow and have the courage to do.</p> <p>Jin \u2013 Mercy or Benevolence As great warriors, samurai have the right power to kill; yet due to the Bushido, Jin is to ensure that their mind and thinking is balanced \u2013 having mercy and sympathy at the proper situation.</p> <p>Jin and the Samurai This is to ensure that the warrior fought for the right reason and belief; it is also to guarantee that if there was no need to kill, the samurai would have mercy.</p> <p>Rei \u2013 Respect Based on the belief of a samurai, it is important that they respect and be polite towards everything. Their way of life meant they should be respectful of elders, respect life, and respect the belief of others.</p> <p>Makoto \u2013 Honesty Honesty was always vital since the warriors believe that honesty in everything they do will acquire respect. It would also mean that they are trustworthy.</p> <p>Meiyo \u2013 Honor Living and dying with great honor was vital to every samurai warrior. Everything they did was with great honor; meaning, everything that they did based on their belief was with honor.</p> <p>Chugi \u2013 Loyalty Another vital aspect of the Bushido was loyalty. The samurai treated each other just like family and would safeguard and help their fellow warriors.</p> <p>This was important because it meant they could trust each other, knowing that they would be loyal despite the circumstances.</p>"},{"location":"devops/","title":"DevOps","text":"<p>The index page for DevOps help topics.</p>"},{"location":"devops/aws/","title":"AWS","text":"<p>The index page for AWS Help Topics</p>"},{"location":"devops/aws/iam/roles/","title":"AWS IAM Roles","text":""},{"location":"devops/aws/iam/roles/#create-iam-user","title":"Create IAM user","text":"<p>Lets create a new IAM user and a new IAM Role in AWS Account using AWS CLI.
